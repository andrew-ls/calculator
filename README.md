# Calculator Project Readme

This project is a simple calculator implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations, view computation history, and clear the history.

## Features

### Calculator Operations

- Addition (`+`)
- Subtraction (`-`)
- Multiplication (`*`)
- Division (`รท`)
- Percentage (`%`)
- Toggle Sign (`+/-`)
- Clear All (`AC`)
- Delete Last Entry (`DE`)
- Decimal Point (`.`)

### Computation History

- Users can view a history of their computations.
- The history is limited to the last 10 entries.

### Clear History

- Users can clear the computation history by clicking the "Clear History" button.

### Toggle History Visibility

- Users can toggle the visibility of the computation history by clicking the "History" button.

## Usage

1. **Performing Calculations**

   - Click on the digits (`0-9`) to input numbers.
   - Use the arithmetic operation buttons (`+, -, *, รท, %`) for calculations.
   - Click the "=" button to see the result on the screen.
   - Use the "AC" button to clear all entries.
   - Use the "DE" button to delete the last entry.
   - Toggle the sign of a number using the "+/-" button.
   - Add decimal points using the "." button.

2. **Viewing Computation History**

   - Click on the "history" button to toggle the visibility of the computation history.
   - The history displays the last 10 computation entries.

3. **Clearing History**

   - Click on the "Clear History" button to remove all computation history.

## Project Structure

  - Defines the structure of the calculator and computation history.
  - Includes necessary elements and classes.

- **CSS (`index.css`):**
  - Styles the calculator and computation history elements.
  - Implements transitions and animations for a smoother user experience.

- **JavaScript (`index.js`):**
  - Defines functionality for the calculator operations.
  - Handles user interactions and updates the screen accordingly.
  - Manages computation history and its visibility.

## Dependencies

- The project has no external dependencies and runs on basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
